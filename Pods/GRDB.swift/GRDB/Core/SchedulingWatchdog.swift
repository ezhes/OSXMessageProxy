import Dispatch

/// SchedulingWatchdog makes sure that databases connections are used on correct
/// dispatch queues, and warns the user with a fatal error whenever she misuses
/// a database connection.
///
/// Generally speaking, each connection has its own dispatch queue. But it's not
/// enough: users need to use two database connections at the same time:
/// <https://github.com/groue/GRDB.swift/issues/55>. To support this use case, a
/// single dispatch queue can be temporarily shared by two or more connections.
///
/// - SchedulingWatchdog.makeSerializedQueue(allowingDatabase:) creates a
///   dispatch queue that allows one database.
///
///   It does so by registering one instance of SchedulingWatchdog as a specific
///   of the dispatch queue, a SchedulingWatchdog that allows that database only.
///
///   Later on, the queue can be shared by several databases with the method
///   inheritingAllowedDatabases(from:execute:). See SerializedDatabase.sync()
///   for an example.
///
/// - preconditionValidQueue() crashes whenever a database is used in an invalid
///   dispatch queue.
